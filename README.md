### Overview 
The purpose of this project was to analyze NYC citibike data to gather key insights based on statistical data of users and the overall bikesharing system

### Results 
The data used throughout this project is from the month of August, chosen because bike rides as usually at a peak during this time of the year with this dataset containing 2,344,224 number of total rides.

For starters, it appears that most users are subsribers of the citibike program and are most likely going to be residents of the area, as seen in the pie chart below where subsribers are orange and customers are blue.

The top starting locations and be seen below in blue, and the top ending locations in orange in the following two maps. Both are concentrated in mid to lower manhattan, where there are more businesses, offices, and tourists.

The following plot displays the peak hours of operation for August which are around 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., typical work hours for office workers. Referring back to the above maps of popular start and ending stations, this would appear to be further evidence that many of the citibike users are residents using citibikes to commute to and from work in the summer months. This plot also indicates what hours would be best for bike maintenances to occur, (perhaps between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.).

The following plot shows that most users took trips under an hour, with most only five minutes of ride time.

The following displays trips taken over the course of the weekday by hour, showing that bike traffic corresponds with office hours.

Gender also seems to play a big part in who uses citibike. According to this dataset, men took the most number of trips with a total number of 1,530,272 trips completed, whereas women took 558,431 trips and unknown users took 225,521 trips, respectively.
The first plot below shows checkout times by gender, and the second plot shows the trip by gender per weekday. Men make up a majority of the users around morning and afternoon work hours on weekdays. The second plot displays the same pattern of trips despite the volume of rides differing between genders, indicating that the same hours of the day see the heaviest volume of riders. It also naturally dispalys the same pattern as the graph above, "Trips By Weekday Per Hour".

Male subscribers make up the majority of users, as reiterated in the heatmap below.

### Summary 
It appears that many of the citibike riders are residents, using the bikesharing program to commute to and from work within the city, which suggests that if a similar bike sharing program were to be started in another city, this would be the target audience to keep in mind when deiciding where to put bike stations.
